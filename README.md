# EXPLORE
📝 Overview
This repository contains two beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebooks created to practice data analysis, visualization, and algorithmic thinking using Python. Both notebooks use matplotlib.pyplot for visualization, while pandas is used in the Volcano notebook for data handling.

📁 Contents
Volcano.ipynb: Analysis and visualization of volcano data using pandas and matplotlib.pyplot

Fibonacci.ipynb: Generation and plotting of the Fibonacci sequence using core Python and matplotlib.pyplot

README.md: Description and setup instructions

data/: (Optional) Folder containing any CSV dataset used for the Volcano notebook

🌋 Volcano Notebook
Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot

Description:

Loads a volcano dataset (from Anaconda or GitHub)

Performs data cleaning (e.g., dropping columns, resetting index)

Visualizes volcano data (e.g., elevation, type, or geographic distribution)

Skills practiced:

Reading and cleaning real-world datasets

Using pandas DataFrames

Creating plots with matplotlib.pyplot

🔢 Fibonacci Notebook
Libraries used: matplotlib.pyplot, Python built-ins

Description:

Generates Fibonacci numbers up to a given term

Plots the sequence to observe growth trends

(Optional) Includes variations like recursive/iterative generation

Skills practiced:

Writing basic Python logic and loops

Visualizing numerical patterns using plots

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash

Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib
Launch Jupyter:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open and run Volcano.ipynb or Fibonacci.ipynb from the interface.

📌 Notes
The volcano dataset is publicly available via Anaconda and/or GitHub, and used here for educational purposes.

Both notebooks are part of my learning journey into Python programming, data analysis, and visualization.

Would you like me to generate a requirements.txt file too for convenience?

Actually not much of pandas just used it for reading the file

Thanks! Since you only used pandas just for reading the file in the Volcano notebook, we'll update the README to reflect that accurately. Here's your final clean and minimal README.md:

📓 Jupyter Notebook Explorations: Volcano & Fibonacci
📝 Overview
This repository contains two beginner-level Jupyter Notebooks:

One that visualizes volcano data

Another that generates and plots the Fibonacci sequence

These notebooks are part of my early practice in Python programming and data visualization using matplotlib. pandas is used minimally for file reading in the Volcano notebook.

📁 Contents
Volcano.ipynb: Visualization of volcano data from a public dataset

Fibonacci.ipynb: Generation and plotting of the Fibonacci series

README.md: Description and usage guide

data/: (Optional) Folder for dataset used in Volcano notebook

🌋 Volcano Notebook
Libraries used: pandas (for reading CSV), matplotlib.pyplot

Description:

Reads volcano dataset (from Anaconda or GitHub)

Drops or modifies columns if needed

Plots relevant features (like elevation or location)

🔢 Fibonacci Notebook
Libraries used: matplotlib.pyplot

Description:

Generates Fibonacci numbers using basic Python logic

Visualizes the sequence using a line or scatter plot

🚀 Getting Started
